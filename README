== Welcome to the Tropo Reminder Demo

This is a Tropo application designed to demonstrate building a reminder application using both Voice and SMS alerts.

== Create application steps or your could simply clone it from github :)

rails new Reminders -d mysql
rails g scaffold Reminder name:string message:text phonenumber:string appointment:datetime
rake db:create
rake db:migrate

delete public/index.html
change root :to => "welcome#index" in config/routes.rb to root :to => "reminders#index"

Add gem 'rest-client' to Gemfile and run bundle install

rails g controller api


Open your web browser to http://localhost:3000

== Create Tropo App using the Scripting API

Copy and paste source code from tropo_scripting_api.rb into separate scripts running under the same application. One for placing outbound voice call reminders and one for sending SMS message reminders.
